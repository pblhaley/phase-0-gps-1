# GPS 1.1: Reflect

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

*I still don't feel completely confident in my knowledge of Git Workflow. I constantly feel the need to check the list to make sure I haven't forgotten anything, but I think with all the practice and repetition, it will sink in. I was not familiar with fetching and merging commands.*

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

*Git fetch and git merge were introduced and clarified. I was also reminded that you have to make sure to update your local version of the master repo before branching.*

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

*I actually am having trouble remembering specific questions I asked. Peter was great answering simple clarification questions. It was also really interesting to here Ryan explain how branching works in a real world scenario-- how there would be a prod-master branch, a dev branch, and the features off the dev branch. Feature branches merge collectively into the dev branch where the whole project can be tested before merging with the live site.*

**What still confuses you about Git?**

*Like I said before, I'm still a bit cloudy on the workflow from time to time, particularly when it comes to communicating between GitHub and my local computer. Luckily, so far, when I've made mistakes, I've been able to back-track or troubleshoot out of them. If if I'm not 100% confident in all my Git knowledge, I still feel good about it. Practice will make perfect.*

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

*It was great! I felt like Peter and I worked really well together, and it was nice to have someone more knowledgeable than either of us hanging out in case we had questions. I feel like it went a little long, but that's probably more a function of everything still being a bit new and not wanting to rush and make simple mistakes. Looking forward to the next one!*
