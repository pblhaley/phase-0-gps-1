# GPS 1.1 - Release 7 - Reflect

1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was really struggling with know when to merge, push, and pull. They all seemed very similar to me and I was having a hard time clarify when each was warranted.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Now I know when each is appropriate! I think the biggest thing I got out of GPS 1.1 was understand when to merge vs. pull vs. push.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked Cate to help me with the workflow between Git and Github. I felt comfortable with the flow in Git itself and the flow once I got to Github, it was how they interact that Cate helped me with. I asked my guide about the difference between fetch and pull and what circumstances would warrant one over the other.

4. What still confuses you about Git?

I still have a little confusion about how often I need to pull down from Github. I know there was a branch that we created on Cate's computer when she was the driver called small-conflict, but I can't seem to find that on my computer or get that on my computer even though I can see it in Github. I'm gonna do some more research on this in the morning and see what I can find.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

My first experience pairing in GPS went really well! I thought Cate and I worked well together and Ryan was helpful when we needed him and politely observant when we didn't. It took a little longer than I thought it would, but it was our first time and I know there's a learning curve to this type of communication. I cleared up some of my Git confusion and overall I feel a lot more comfortable with the workflow. I'm very happy with how the GPS went today!
